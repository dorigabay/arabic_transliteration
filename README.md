# Arabic to Hebrew Transliteration

This Python project converts Arabic text into Hebrew letters to help Hebrew readers pronounce Arabic words accurately.
Our aim is to facilitate Arabic language learning for Hebrew speakers, bridging the gap between the two languages.

Please feel free to share any suggestions for improving this tool or enhancing the learning experience for Arabic and Hebrew.
